<p>Friday evening saw dueling blog posts from TechCrunch and Upload with the news that Upload had laid off all of its staff at its Los Angeles co-working space and given the lease at its San Francisco location over to a blockchain accelerator. TechCrunch's emotionally charged post started off with the headline "<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/1/14/vr-startup-upload-shuts-down-its-offices-as-funding-from-oculus-founder-runs-out/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VR startup Upload shuts down its offices as funding from Oculus founder Palmer Luckey runs out</a>" (Upload has never confirmed Luckey's investment) and immediately mentioned the firm's struggles with sexual harassment allegations.</p>

<p>Upload quickly fired back with an angry missive calling the Techcrunch article "false news" and characterizing the development as a pivot: "<a href="https://upload.io/upload-focuses-future-xr-education-media/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Upload focuses on future of XR education and media</a>".</p>

<p>Upload says that the UploadVR blog we frequently link to will be unaffected, confirmed by Ian Hamilton as far as he is aware:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For clarity: Iâ€™ve been told I still have a job. Iâ€™ve only ever worked for this company from home. So right now, it is business as usual for me and the media team. <a href="https://t.co/LD3HnajuP6">https://t.co/LD3HnajuP6</a></p>&mdash; Ian Hamilton ðŸš™ GDC (@hmltn) <a href="https://twitter.com/hmltn/status/974807043700809700?ref_src=twsrc%3Etfw">March 15, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>The author of TechCrunch's article explained why he didn't buy their response on Twitter (note that he altered the quotation):</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Upload denying that Palmer Luckey is an investor here and saying that the former employee accused of having sex in the office is no longer working there, presumably bc they laid off everyone in the LA office..</p>&mdash; Lucas Matney (@lucasmtny) <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny/status/974836812609830900?ref_src=twsrc%3Etfw">March 15, 2016</a></blockquote>
